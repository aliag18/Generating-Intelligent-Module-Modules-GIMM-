# Model for increased renewable energy use
Theses codes are designed to increase the share of renewable energy used in remote communities. They were designed as a capstone project through Simon Fraser University's Sustainable Energy Engineering Program. This project was designed for Hedgehog Technologies and are configured for use with Nimba's historical load data. These codes include an LSTM model for load prediction, solar module to determine anticipated solar power production, and a controller to regulate renewable energy use. 

## Input Features:
* Weather information
	* temperature
	* long-wave radiation
	* short-wave radiation
	* wind speed
* Time information
	* hour-of-the-day
